**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
  * Testing software ensures it is functional, however, the tests have to be designed properly. White-box testing allows the developer to see where issues are occurring, where black-box testing tests allows the developer to check functionality. OOP principles provide security through encapsulation and need to be incorporated into software design.
  
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
  * User needs can be represented with use cases. Tests can be created to ensure the use cases actually meet requirements. It's important to consider bias when creating tests so that defects are not introduced. The user needs should be translated to software requirements and all code should be designed around those requirements.

**How do I approach designing software?**
  * I approach designing software by focusing on requirements that meet the userâ€™s needs. Once the requirements are discovered, testing needs to be prioritized when analyzing and designing system components. Software needs to be developed with testing in mind; it should be tested as it's developed to ensure defects aren't introduced.
